## Background

The rising cost of living is putting real pressure on people’s wallets, affecting everything from groceries and rent to commuting and utility bills. While there are budgeting tools out there, many people still don’t have effective ways to track and manage their spending day-to-day, especially when it comes to recurring household expenses like energy and water. Often, bills for these essentials arrive at the end of the month with little to no breakdown of how the charges were calculated, leaving people in the dark about what they’re actually paying for. This lack of transparency tends to put the power in the hands of the utility companies, rather than the consumers.

Even though there are plenty of providers to choose from, the hassle of switching — and the uncertainty about whether it will actually save money — keeps many people stuck with the same supplier. Without clear data on how much energy or water they’re using and what it costs, it’s hard to know if switching would make any real difference.

But what if control became decentralized and shifted directly to the consumer? With a detailed, transparent breakdown of their energy and water usage, people could see exactly where their money is going. This kind of decentralized data access would enable consumers to negotiate better deals with providers or make smarter choices about switching, tailored to their specific needs. By decentralizing access to utility data, we empower consumers with the insight they need to foster a more competitive market, potentially leading to fairer pricing and more control over household expenses.
