Our goal is to empower customers with greater control over their energy data, giving them tools to monitor usage at a more detailed level than ever before. By developing a system of IoT devices and nodes that connect to the blockchain, we can offer consumers a transparent, decentralized platform to view their energy consumption patterns. This allows them to track exactly where and when energy is used, make smarter choices to reduce costs, and compare their usage with similar households on competing providers. With this granular insight and secure data access, customers can choose the best provider for their needs and potentially negotiate better deals, fostering a more consumer-driven and competitive energy market.

## Background

The rising cost of living is putting real pressure on people’s wallets, affecting everything from groceries and rent to commuting and utility bills. While there are budgeting tools out there, many people still don’t have effective ways to track and manage their spending day-to-day, especially when it comes to recurring household expenses like energy and water. Often, bills for these essentials arrive at the end of the month with little to no breakdown of how the charges were calculated, leaving people in the dark about what they’re actually paying for. This lack of transparency tends to put the power in the hands of the utility companies, rather than the consumers.

Even though there are plenty of providers to choose from, the hassle of switching — and the uncertainty about whether it will actually save money — keeps many people stuck with the same supplier. Without clear data on how much energy or water they’re using and what it costs, it’s hard to know if switching would make any real difference.

But what if control became decentralized and shifted directly to the consumer? With a detailed, transparent breakdown of their energy and water usage, people could see exactly where their money is going. This kind of decentralized data access would enable consumers to negotiate better deals with providers or make smarter choices about switching, tailored to their specific needs. By decentralizing access to utility data, we empower consumers with the insight they need to foster a more competitive market, potentially leading to fairer pricing and more control over household expenses.

## Being Smart

Smart meters in the UK are part of the solution to improve energy transparency by automatically tracking electricity and gas usage in real time. Once installed, these meters connect to a centralized network, the [Data Communications Company (DCC)](https://www.smartdcc.co.uk/about-dcc/who-we-are/), which securely collects data from millions of households and relays it to energy providers. This setup removes the need for manual readings, providing consumers with regular updates on their energy consumption through an in-home display (IHD). However, because the system is centralized, consumers have limited control over how this data is used in interactions with providers.

The data transmission works through a network of sensors within the smart meter, which continually monitor energy usage. This data is encrypted and securely sent via radio waves to a local communications hub in the home, which then transmits it over the DCC network. This central network ensures data reaches the energy provider while keeping it private, yet the reliance on centralized control limits flexibility for consumers to manage or share their data independently.

## Being Smarter

Currently, energy data from smart meters is securely transmitted to a central network (like the UK's Data Communications Company, DCC), which relays information to energy providers. However, centralization means that customers have limited access to their data and rely on providers to interpret it for them, potentially creating a power imbalance. Integrating blockchain technology could enhance this by decentralizing data access, allowing customers to control and share their data on a secure, tamper-proof network.

## Keeping Users Safe

Storing sensitive data off the blockchain is essential for protecting user privacy and ensuring compliance with regulations. Tamper-proof hardware will play a crucial role in this process by securely storing essential information, including cryptographic keys for encryption and identity verification, as well as user credentials that confirm energy usage without disclosing personal identifiable information (PII). This hardware will manage access control permissions and store usage patterns for insights, effectively tracking interactions and detecting unauthorized access attempts through detailed audit logs. Additionally, it will uphold data-sharing rules established by users, such as expiration dates or usage limits, while performing integrity checks to ensure the firmware remains secure. This robust storage solution not only fortifies overall system security but also empowers users to confidently control and share their energy data.
