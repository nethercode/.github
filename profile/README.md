## Background

The rising cost of living is putting real pressure on people’s wallets, affecting everything from groceries and rent to commuting and utility bills. While there are budgeting tools out there, many people still don’t have effective ways to track and manage their spending day-to-day, especially when it comes to recurring household expenses like energy and water. Often, bills for these essentials arrive at the end of the month with little to no breakdown of how the charges were calculated, leaving people in the dark about what they’re actually paying for. This lack of transparency tends to put the power in the hands of the utility companies, rather than the consumers.

Even though there are plenty of providers to choose from, the hassle of switching — and the uncertainty about whether it will actually save money — keeps many people stuck with the same supplier. Without clear data on how much energy or water they’re using and what it costs, it’s hard to know if switching would make any real difference.

But what if control became decentralized and shifted directly to the consumer? With a detailed, transparent breakdown of their energy and water usage, people could see exactly where their money is going. This kind of decentralized data access would enable consumers to negotiate better deals with providers or make smarter choices about switching, tailored to their specific needs. By decentralizing access to utility data, we empower consumers with the insight they need to foster a more competitive market, potentially leading to fairer pricing and more control over household expenses.

## Being Smart

Smart meters in the UK are part of the solution to improve energy transparency by automatically tracking electricity and gas usage in real time. Once installed, these meters connect to a centralized network, the [Data Communications Company (DCC)](https://www.smartdcc.co.uk/about-dcc/who-we-are/), which securely collects data from millions of households and relays it to energy providers. This setup removes the need for manual readings, providing consumers with regular updates on their energy consumption through an in-home display (IHD). However, because the system is centralized, consumers have limited control over how this data is used in interactions with providers.

The data transmission works through a network of sensors within the smart meter, which continually monitor energy usage. This data is encrypted and securely sent via radio waves to a local communications hub in the home, which then transmits it over the DCC network. This central network ensures data reaches the energy provider while keeping it private, yet the reliance on centralized control limits flexibility for consumers to manage or share their data independently.
